## How it works
All of the data for this application is returned through edge functions from various providers (Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge Functions, Netlify Edge Functions). Read more about the benefits of the PlanetScale serverless driver for JavaScript and the next generation of PlanetScale infrastruction in [our latest blog post](https://planetscale.com/blog/introducing-the-planetscale-serverless-driver-for-javascript). 

Each of these edge functions connects to a PlanetScale database via our serverless driver, [`@planetscale/database`](https://github.com/planetscale/database-js), and returns a JSON payload with F1 stats to render the page.

You can use these as examples for how to start using your PlanetScale database from an edge function.

The frontend application is a Next.js app running on Vercel.

> Note: Before using [`@planetscale/database`](https://github.com/planetscale/database-js), make sure to enroll your database in the **PlanetScale serverless driver for JavaScript** beta (under your database's **Settings** > **Beta features** section). 

## Local development
